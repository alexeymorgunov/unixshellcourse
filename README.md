## Introduction to Unix shell 2

**Work in progress, please check back later for more!**

This short course is based on some reference style notes and exercises. Start by looking at the notes and trying to solve some exercises in parallel.

Begin here: [Notes](Notes1.md). Try to go through the [Orienteering](Orienteering.md) exercise and understand how the most basic commands work. Even if this isn't your first time with shell, you might find it useful as a refresher.

Then attempt the [Exercises](Exercises1.md). [Answers](Answers1.md) to exercises. Please only check them once you have given the exercises a proper try.

Continue with [Notes 2](Notes2.md), attempting the [Exercises 2](Exercises2.md). (You don't necessarily have to solve every single scripting one, it might take too long, just try a couple.) [Answers 2](Answers2.md) to exercises 2. Please only check them once you have given the exercises a proper try.

This is the part where I'd love to link to my personal website, but it is still work in progress, so for now I'll just leave a link to the [verb conjugation resource in many languages](http://cooljugator.com) that I built together with a friend over the past year. Lots of shell scripting was used in the process of building it, and I actually used my own course notes as reference all the time!:D
